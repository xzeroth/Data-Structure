When removing #include<iostream> from test file, there was no error. However removing from header file cause an error.

Same with removing using namespace std. Removing from test file didnt cause any error but it did on head file.

So I am guessing if something is declared in header file and header file is called. I do not have to re declare it on the test file.

Q. Is this mean I can declare everything in header file and not in test file?
