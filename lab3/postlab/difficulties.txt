Q. Difficulties.
A. I didn't really have too much difficulties implementing stack data structure. However, when adding option to take in string gave me an error many times. First of all I can't use formatted intake "cin" and head to use "getline()". Also previous input won't let my other inputs run. So I had to use a line of code to discard all the char inputs that was already inserted.
